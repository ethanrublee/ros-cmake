straszheim> i'm going the gentoo route for crosscompiling
straszheim> have my gentoo VM up
straszheim> crossdev --target arm-unknown-linux-gnu is finished
straszheim> thought I'd see if there is anything
DanielStonier> you'll have to init the emerge wrapper
straszheim> do you build the entire embedded OS with this?
DanielStonier> emerge-wrapper --init
straszheim> symlinks set up.
DanielStonier> i used it to build the base filesystem a couple of times
DanielStonier> other times if I need to be really lean I stitch it together by hand
DanielStonier> the cross-emerge packages aren't perfect, so depending on what you want, 
               you'll get so far...
DanielStonier> the guys on the #gentoo embedded irc are usually pretty good
DanielStonier> you should be able to do a emerge-arm-unknown-linux-gnu --sync now
 straszheim watches it spin
DanielStonier> one sec, have to dig up my other brain to remember some stuff :P (wiki at 
               home)
straszheim> i figure I want to run a node
straszheim> where do you get the OS'es that you run on your boards?
DanielStonier> been a while now, but you might want to check the issues i had here : 
norriheim.dnsdojo.com/doku/doku.php/en:programming:ide:crossdev:portage
DanielStonier> i run a gentoo filesystem on my ros testing board for armv6
DanielStonier> on the actual cleaning robot though, we're still using the original os 
               from before I joined the project
DanielStonier> its supplied by a linux company here in seoul
DanielStonier> but we've wasted more time dealing with their issues than I would have 
               had doing it myself
DanielStonier> we also used a ppc board once....used eldk to build that one
straszheim> this linaro thing looks like it will be interesting, but it just isn't ready 
            yet
straszheim> so I figure I'll do whatever you do
straszheim> the gentoo filesystem on ros testing board sounds good
DanielStonier> you'll probably want to edit your cflags before you really start compiling
DanielStonier> what cpu did you end up running?
DanielStonier> ^purchasing?
straszheim> i'm going with qemu for now
straszheim> it is possible to run linux in a chroot on android
straszheim> so my phone is a possiblity
DanielStonier> oh....im curious about rooting android, but haven't investigated it yet
DanielStonier> so if you're crossing for your qemu rootstock, is that like armv7 arch?
straszheim> it has various
straszheim> http://codepad.org/kegCfOsS
straszheim> hmm, the rootstock, indeed.
straszheim> I'd thought I should build the entire OS with the crosscompiler
DanielStonier> ok...so you're not going to use the rootstock
straszheim> so everything matches.  but maybe that will just work.
DanielStonier> just cross a filesystem and then launch that with qemu
DanielStonier> i did that a while ago with a qemu-chroot
DanielStonier> got some notes somewhere, one sec
DanielStonier> are you using a full blown qemu or a qemu root?
DanielStonier> ^qemu chroot?
straszheim> open to either
DanielStonier> i found the chroot easier if you don't need guis
DanielStonier> its faster as well
straszheim> just want to be able to run talker/listener at this point
straszheim> (provided they compile, that's a different issue)
DanielStonier> ok...step by step:
DanielStonier> 1) set up a qemu chroot
DanielStonier> 2) download a stage3 for some arm achitecture you want to test on
DanielStonier> 3) crossdev a toolchain
DanielStonier> then you should be able to compile either inside the chroot or 
               cross-compile from crossdev and be matching
DanielStonier> just make sure the CFLAGS in /etc/make in and out match
straszheim> ah
DanielStonier> using the stage3 saves you having to build the whole filesystem, then you 
               can just cross-compile ros stuff outside
DanielStonier> i have some rough notes on setting up qemu with a stage3 here:
DanielStonier> http://snorriheim.dnsdojo.com/redmine/wiki/ecl/Qemu_chroot
DanielStonier> qemu chroot that is
straszheim> okay this sounds tractable
straszheim> i didn't realize there were ARM stage3's available
straszheim> big win
straszheim> awesome.  okay thanks.   
DanielStonier> yep, they're still there
DanielStonier> ook...i'll have to copy paste the scripts i use there on that page, you 
               can't see them without being logged in to that redmine
DanielStonier> ok, added the scripts to the page
DanielStonier> bug me if you run into problems
DanielStonier> I'm currently retargetting eros for ros trunk, should be finished and 
                      testing shortly.
