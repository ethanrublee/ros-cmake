   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.


Code
----

ros-cmake is in the 'ros-cmake' repository at
https://github.com/straszheim/ros-cmake.  The git clone url is
``git://github.com/straszheim/ros-cmake.git``.  Don't run off and
clone it yet; use the walkthrough.  But **dont do this yet**, follow
the directions below.


Just Run It
-----------

You can copy these lines one-by-one into a shell buffer::

   mkdir tmp
   cd tmp
   wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/straszheim/ros-cmake/raw/master/run_full_build_from_scratch.sh 
   sh ./run_full_build_from_scratch.sh

And you'll find the results in subdirectory work-cmake.  See the
`walkthrough` for more details and the manual version.
